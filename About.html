        <h2 class="SCH">Our Company</h2>
        <p class="SP">When the COVID-19 pandemic upended daily life in the United States, our founding doctors had a dilemma. We wanted to continue 
        to offer our services to our patients without putting their health at risk. As a result, in March 2020, our telemedicine company 
        MedDynamic was launched. At the launch of our company, we had only a few customers and five doctors. Since then, we have been gaining 
        many customers and have even employed many medical professionals from various fields to work for our company as well. We have expanded 
        our company to provide services to other countries and have quickly been reaching new milestones. We strive to make our website as 
        streamlined as possible for our users, so we hope that your experience with us goes smoothly.</p>
