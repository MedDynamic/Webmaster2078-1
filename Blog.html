      <h2> Dr. Phillip and Dr. Sandy to the MedDynamic Family!</h2>
      <h5>May 3, 2021</h5>
      <img class="size-1"src="Image 1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"
      <p>We have two new doctors who have recently joined us in our mission to provide health care through our online services.</p>
      <p>These doctors have graduated from Harvard and John Hopkins University, and we are very excited to see what they can provide!</p>

      <h2>Take Care of your Teeth!</h2>
      <h5>April 7, 2021</h5>
      <img class="size-1"src="Image 9.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"
      <p>Although brushing your teeth twice everyday may seem like a tedious task, it is essential for having good oral health. Brushing your teeth twice a day can kill up to 99.9% of all germs in your teeth; it is really astonishing. Along with the germs being killed, all of the food and plaque in your teeth are removed from brushing, and who really wants food stuck in their teeth all day and night? Also, make sure to floss your teeth and use mouth wash every now and then to make sure your teeth are shining bright!</p>

      <h2>1,000,000 users</h2>
      <h5> February 1, 2021</h5>
      <img class="size-1"src="Image 3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"
      <p>Thank you all so much for 1,000,000 users!</p>
      <p>We started our online health services due to the coronavirus pandemic, but we realized that this service is not just useful during these pandemic times, but it can be equally as helpful for patients with strict schedules. It is amazing how we have gotten one million users before our one year aniversary, and we will continue to work toward making your experience better.</p>

      <h2>Welcome Canada!</h2>
      <h5> January 1, 2021</h5>
      <img class="size-1"src="Image 4.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"
      <p>We have extended our online services to Canada to help make our company international.</p>
      <p>There are several doctors who will be able to help individuals from Canada get check-ups and other health services. We have heard the voices of the people and are trying to spread our services to a larger array of countries and we aim on expanding to the United Kingdom and Australia next.</p>

      <h2>Donating $100,000 to the American Red Cross</h2>
      <h5>December 25, 2020</h5>
      <img class="size-1"src="Image 2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"
      <p>During these harsh pandemic times, we understand how much organizations need our help to continue functioning, so we donated $100,000 to the American Red Cross!</p>
      <p>Due to all of the recent support we have been getting from our users, we were able to afford donating this money to this foundation and, in the future, we hope to donate money to other great organizations.</p>

      <h2>Stay Safe during the Holiday Season!</h2>
      <h5>December 1, 2020</h5>
      <img class="size-1"src="Image 10.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"
      <p>The holiday season is a time of rejoice, travel, festivity, and joy, but this year is unlike any other. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we advise all people, whether young or old, to stay socially distant (six feet apart) and wear masks in the public. Whenever it is possible, please use hand sanitizer or wash your hands with soap after touching any appliances to reduce the risk of getting the virus. Take care!</p>

      <h2>MedDynamic Fitness!</h2>
      <h5>July 1, 2020</h5>
      <img class="size-1"src="Image 7.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"
      <p>Doing exercise everyday is crucial for good health and allows you to live a long and healthy life. Due to our strong beliefs of doing exercise and our desire to help all of our patients have a good lifestyle, we have created the MedDynamic Fitness app! This app can be bought from the ApplePlay Store™ and Google Pay™, and is essential for helping out with your fitness. When you have enabled the application and have brought your phone for your exercise session, the app can track the amount of calories burned, the amount of time exercised, and provide exercise recommendations.</p>

      <h5>March 26, 2020</h5>
      <img class="size-1"src="Image 8.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has come as a shock to many individuals, including us, and our virtual Medical company has been very helpful for many individuals. Due to our desire to give all of our patients the best experience possible via a digital platform, we have decided to recruit several new doctors. All of these doctors have graduated from prestigious schools such as John Hopkins, and have a strong desire to help others in any way possible. </p>
